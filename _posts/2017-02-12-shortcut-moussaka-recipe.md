I made this and followed the recipe closely. I take offence at the title, it's not a "shortcut". I'll make this again but I would definitely make some changes.

Next time:
<ul>
 	<li>skip the breadcrumbs</li>
 	<li>use canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. We found it was dryer than expected.</li>
 	<li>incorporate thinly sliced potatoes.</li>
</ul>
I'm not into "deconstructed" recipes but you could separate this easily into a potato side with the meat/eggplant/sliced potato/onion mix.
