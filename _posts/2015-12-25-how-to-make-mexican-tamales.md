<blockquote>I shied away from making tamales at home for the longest time, believing it was an undertaking so labor-intensive that it was only worth doing with the help of many, many extra hands. Turns out I was wrongâ€”tamales, while requiring a small amount of assembly time, really aren't all that hard or time-consuming to make at all. After a few rounds of recipe testing, this version with three options for fillings will give you plenty of light, tender, airy, and incredibly flavor tamales that you can eat for meals, snacks, and even freeze for later.</blockquote>
