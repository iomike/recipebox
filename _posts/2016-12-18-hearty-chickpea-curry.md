<h2>Notes</h2>
<a href="http://recipebox.mkelley.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hpMnPKj.gif"><img class="wp-image-464 size-medium alignright" src="http://recipebox.mkelley.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hpMnPKj-300x300.gif" width="300" height="300" /></a>Trying this recipe out, I improvised a couple of things .

I added cayenne pepper instead of the chili pods. I also didn't puree' the tomatoes and onions, I took the advice of someone in the Reddit comments and cooked the shit out of the tomatoes and onions instead.

I wish I listened to them about not using the coconut cream. When I do this again, I'll use a tablespoon of the coconut cream and add sour cream, &amp; plain greek yogurt. You want the taste and the sweetness of the coconut cream but the yogurt or sour cream will add more of the creaminess.
