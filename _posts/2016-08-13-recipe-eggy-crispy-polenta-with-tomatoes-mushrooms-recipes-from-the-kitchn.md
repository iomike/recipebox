<blockquote>I love modular meals. Does that sound a weird word to apply to cooking? Let's say mix-and-match and make-ahead. Take this breakfast recipe, for instance. It depends on a couple of pieces that you can make ahead, then assemble quickly for a hot, savory meal that wouldn't be out of place in a nice restaurant. But with 10 minutes of work you can have it for breakfast tomorrow!</blockquote>
