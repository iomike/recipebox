I hate to start on such a negative note, especially when these little ricotta-stuffed rolls turned out to be so stinking good, but I'm not so drawn to these recipes anymore, the ones that call for salting and draining and blotting dry, or for deep frying, or for assembling little parcels, as adorable as they may be. But I've had this recipe bookmarked since last Christmas</blockquote>
