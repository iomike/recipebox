<blockquote>Sometimes it’s okay to take the easy way out, like with these two takes on your new small space staples: recipes you prep, cook, and eat from a mug. With a savory and sweet option, we've got your next week of meals covered. Photos and recipes by Jessie Snyder  Savory Recipe: The Burrito Mug Serves one.  Ingredients Cooked brown rice Canned black beans Your favorite pico de gallo (or salsa) A few pinches of salt Your favorite corn chips Diced avocado Directions: You can either buy pre-cooked/packaged rice at the grocery store, use leftovers from takeout earlier that week, or cook a batch in the microwave. To cook in the microwave: combine 1 part rice to 2 parts water in a microwave safe bowl, cover, and microwave on high until all of the water is absorbed. Cooking times will vary depending on the amount of rice, but a 1/2 cup of uncooked rice usually takes around 10 minutes.  Place a few scoops each of the brown rice, black beans, and pico de gallo (or salsa) in a mug. Give it a stir, and microwave on high for 1 minute to heat. Season with salt, to taste.  The best part? The toppings: finish off your mug dinner with more pico/salsa, a few corn chips broken into pieces, and diced avocado. A spoonful of sour cream and a squeeze of lime is also good here (but the options are limitless...make it your own!)  microwave and cook for 1:30-2:00 minutes on high. (Mine usually takes 2 minutes.) The surface should be cooked (it won’t brown) and slightly spring back when you press down on it with your finger. Let cool for a few minutes before topping with a scoop of ice scream — and, if you have them, sprinkles! Then dig in...a warm, gooey (two-minute) cookie! Shop Cookbooks Shop Mugs</blockquote>
