<blockquote>Like the ones made by Hostess, my Donettes are fluffy bites of yellow cake swaddled in a messy coat of powdered sugar, and small enough to eat by the handful. They're a little tangy like the original, but from thick Greek yogurt rather than some mystery additive, with a vibrant color and custardy richness from egg yolks. But the real secret is refined coconut oil, which is odorless at high heat and happens to be the tastiest fry oil around.</blockquote>
